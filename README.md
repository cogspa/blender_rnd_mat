# blender_rnd_mat
# his script will create a new material with a random color for each mesh object in the scene. This material will be applied to the mesh, replacing any existing materials. Note that this script uses the Principled BSDF shader, which is the default shader in Blender 2.8 and onwards. The alpha value is set to 1 for all materials, meaning they will be fully opaque. If you want the colors to have random alpha values as well, you could change the alpha assignment line to random.random().

# To run this script, open a Text Editor window in Blender, create a new text block, paste the script into it, and then press the 'Run Script' button or use the Alt+P hotkey.
